    <h1>Career Goals</h1>
    <p>My goal in this course is to gain the skills necessary to become a proficient web developer.
    Seattle is becoming a worldwide tech leader and I would like to capitalize on the opportunity we
    have here, either with an established company or a startup. I wish to remain in the Pacific Northwest
    for years to come.</p>
